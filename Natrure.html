            <p>A monkey is any primate that is not a human, prosimian (lemurs, sifakas, lorises, pottos, bush babies, and other
                 primitive primates), or ape. Monkeys make up two of the three groups of simian primates, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. 
                The other group is the apes.</p>
